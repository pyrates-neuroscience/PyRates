        "\nA Mean-Field Model of a Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) Neuron Population\n============================================================================\n\nHere, we will introduce the QIF population mean-field model, which has been derived from a population of all-to-all\ncoupled QIF neurons in [1]_. The model equations are given by:\n\n\\begin{align}\\tau \\dot r = \\frac{\\Delta}{\\pi\\tau} + 2 r v, \n\n    \\tau \\dot v = v^2 +\\bar\\eta + I(t) + J r \\tau - (\\pi r \\tau)^2,\\end{align}\n\nwhere $r$ is the average firing rate and $v$ is the average membrane potential of the QIF population [1]_.\nIt is governed by 4 parameters:\n    - $\\tau$ --> the population time constant\n    - $\\bar \\eta$ --> the mean of a Lorenzian distribution over the neural excitability in the population\n    - $\\Delta$ --> the half-width at half maximum of the Lorenzian distribution over the neural excitability\n    - $J$ --> the strength of the recurrent coupling inside the population\nThis mean-field model is an exact representation of the macroscopic firing rate and membrane potential dynamics of a\nspiking neural network consisting of QIF neurons with Lorentzian distributed background excitabilities.\nWhile the mean-field derivation is mathematically only valid for all-to-all coupled populations of infinite size,\nit has been shown that there is a close correspondence between the mean-field model and neural populations with\nsparse coupling and population sizes of a few thousand neurons [2]_. In the same work, it has been demonstrated how to\nextend the model by adding synaptic dynamics or additional adaptation currents to the single cell network, that can be\ncarried through the mean-field derivation performed in [1]_. For example, a QIF population with spike-frequency\nadaptation would be given by the following 4D system:\n\n\\begin{align}\\tau \\dot r = \\frac{\\Delta}{\\pi\\tau} + 2 r v, \n\n    \\tau \\dot v = v^2 +\\bar\\eta + I(t) + J r \\tau - A - (\\pi r \\tau)^2, \n\n    \\tau_A \\dot A = B, \n\n    \\tau_A \\dot B = \\alpha r - 2 B - A,\\end{align}\n\nwhere the evolution equations for $A$ and $B$ express a convolution of $r$ with an alpha kernel, with\nadaptation strength $\\alpha$ and time constant $\\tau_A$.\n\nIn the sections below, we will demonstrate for each model how to load the model template into pyrates, perform\nsimulations with it and visualize the results.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n..

This method returns a :code:`CircuitTemplate` instance\nwhich provides the method :code:`apply()` for turning it into a graph-based representation, i.e. a\n:code:`pyrates.ir.CircuitIR` instance. Have a look at the yaml definition of the model that can be found at the path\nused for the :code:`from_yaml()` method. You will see that all variables and parameters are already defined there.\nThese are the basic steps you perform, if you want to load a model that is\ndefined inside a yaml file.
