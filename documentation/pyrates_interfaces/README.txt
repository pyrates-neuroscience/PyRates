PyRates user interfaces: From model definition to simulation
------------------------------------------------------------

In PyRates, neurodynamic models are defined via sets of differential equations, for which solutions with respect to time
can be found numerically. Such models can be defined via two different interfaces in PyRates: via YAML files or via the
Python frontend. Once the models are defined, they can be compiled for numerical integration in time or parameter
continuations. In this gallery, we will provide walk-throughs for all features and options that you have at each step
between defining a model in PyRates and performing basic numerical simulations in time.
