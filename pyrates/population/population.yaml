CurrentToPotentialOperator:
  description: "Generic current-to-potential operator (CPO) to be replaced
    with a meaningful function. The CPO collect contributions from synapses
    to a mean membrane current which leads to a change in mean somatic
    membrane voltage in the neural population."
  base: pyrates.operator.operator.OperatorTemplate

    "L_m * V = k * I"

      description: >
        Generic scaling constant that transforms current to voltage.
        Depending on the model, this scaling may be interpreted as
        a conductivity of the somatic membrane.
        Note: This may be scalar or vector form.

      description: >
        Electric current across synaptic membrane reflecting synaptic
        activation due to a pre-synaptic firing rate.
