InstantaneousCPO:
  description: >
    Implementation of a current-to-potential operator (CPO) that sums all synaptic
    (current) contributions and instantaneously, i.e. without temporal derivative,
    transforms those currents into a mean somatic membrane potential.
  base: pyrates.population.CurrentToPotentialOperator

JansenRitCPO:
  description: >
    Implementation and parametrization of a CPO based on the Jansen-Rit
    neural mass model [1].
